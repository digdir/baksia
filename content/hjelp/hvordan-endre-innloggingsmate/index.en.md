{{< alert type="warning">}}
We are phasing out pin codes. All pin codes will become invalid and can no longer be used for logging in.
To continue using MinID, you must change the login method to a one-time code via SMS or the MinID app.
{{< /alert >}}

In future, MinID will have two different login methods that can be used:
- MinID app
- One-time codes on SMS

**MinID App**   
With the MinID app, you can easily confirm login on your mobile.
- To use the MinID app on mobile, you need to download the app from Google Play or the App Store. [Read more here](https://minid.no/en/get-started/minid-app)

**One-time codes on SMS**   
You can also change the login method to one-time codes via SMS in [MinID settings](https://brukerprofil.difi.no/minprofil/minid/).
- Select MinID as login method and log in
- Select "Code on SMS"
