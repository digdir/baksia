title: Get to know our strategy!
ingress: The public sector must become a world leader in digitization - and The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency (Digdir) must be the government's foremost tool for faster and more coordinated digitization of society. Our efforts - in close collaboration with others - will lead to citizens, business and voluntary organizations experiencing one digital public sector and a simpler digital everyday life. That is Digdir's ambition and vision.
